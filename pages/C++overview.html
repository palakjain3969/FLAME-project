        Unlock the world of system-level programming with C and C++. Start by
        understanding memory management, pointers, loops, and functions in C.
        Then move on to C++ with object-oriented programming, classes,
        constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism. These languages teach you
        to think deeply about how code interacts with hardware and memory —
        essential for performance-critical applications. Used in game engines,
        real-time systems, and competitive programming, C/C++ remains a
        cornerstone of serious software engineering. This course is ideal for
        students preparing for technical interviews, developers aiming to
        optimize performance, or anyone who wants to understand what’s happening
        under the hood of modern software. Build a strong foundation in
        computing from the ground up.
