        Java powers everything from mobile apps to enterprise systems — and this
        course teaches you how to master it. You’ll begin with core Java syntax:
        variables, control structures, loops, and methods. From there, you'll
        dive into object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance, polymorphism,
        and exception handling. Build real Java programs as you learn,
        reinforcing every concept with hands-on experience. Perfect for learners
        aiming to build Android apps, work with enterprise-grade software, or
        prepare for backend development, this course lays a strong foundation in
        a language trusted by banks, tech giants, and universities alike.
        Develop the problem-solving mindset and logical thinking that Java
        encourages — and create applications built to scale.
