        Explore the fascinating world of AI and machine learning — even if
        you’re new to math and programming. This course breaks down complex
        concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, regression,
        classification, and neural networks into easy-to-digest lessons. You’ll
        use Python along with libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Keras
        to train real models on real data. From building a spam filter to
        predicting housing prices, this course is hands-on, project-based, and
        perfect for anyone curious about the brains behind smart tech.
