          Unlock the world of system-level programming with C and C++. Start by
          understanding memory management, pointers, loops, and functions in C.
          Then move on to C++ with object-oriented programming, classes,
          constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism.
          <br /><br />
          These languages teach you to think deeply about how code interacts with
          hardware and memory — essential for performance-critical applications.
          Used in game engines, real-time systems, and competitive programming,
          C/C++ remains a cornerstone of serious software engineering.
          <br /><br />
          This course is ideal for students preparing for technical interviews,
          developers aiming to optimize performance, or anyone who wants to
          understand what’s happening under the hood of modern software. Build a
          strong foundation in computing from the ground up.
