          Explore the fascinating world of AI and machine learning — even if
          you’re new to math and programming. This course breaks down complex
          concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, regression,
          classification, and neural networks into easy-to-digest lessons.
          <br /><br />
          You’ll use Python along with libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Keras
          to train real models on real data. From building a spam filter to
          predicting housing prices, this course is hands-on, project-based, and
          perfect for anyone curious about the brains behind smart tech.
